## GPU_CLOCK measurements

The Device Metrics Exporter `gpu_clock` metric is a common field used for exporting different types of clocks. This metric has a `clock_type` label added to the metric to differentiate the different clock types:

```json
gpu_clock{clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_DATA"}
gpu_clock{clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_SYSTEM"}
gpu_clock{clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_MEMORY"}
gpu_clock{clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_VIDEO"}
```

An example of this is shown below:

```json
gpu_clock{card_model="xxxx",clock_index="14",clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_DATA",gpu_compute_partition_type="spx",gpu_id="3",gpu_partition_id="0",hostname="xxxx",serial_number="xxxx"} 22
gpu_clock{card_model="xxxx",clock_index="2",clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_SYSTEM",gpu_compute_partition_type="spx",gpu_id="0",gpu_partition_id="0",hostname="xxxx",serial_number="xxxx"} 132
gpu_clock{card_model="xxxx",clock_index="8",clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_MEMORY",gpu_compute_partition_type="spx",gpu_id="0",gpu_partition_id="0",hostname="xxxx",serial_number="xxxx"} 900
gpu_clock{card_model="xxxx",clock_index="9",clock_type="GPU_CLOCK_TYPE_VIDEO",gpu_compute_partition_type="spx",gpu_id="5",gpu_partition_id="0",hostname="xxxx",serial_number="xxxx"} 29
```

## XGMI Link Read and Write measurements

The Device Metrics Exporter `gpu_xgmi_link_rx` and `gpu_xgmi_link_tx` metrics consist of an array field used for exporting the transfer metrics for each xgmi link connected to a GPU. These metric have a `link_index` label added to the metric to differentiate the different links (usually 8 in an MI300X system):

```json
gpu_xgmi_link_rx{link_index="0"}
gpu_xgmi_link_rx{link_index="1"}
gpu_xgmi_link_rx{link_index="2"}
gpu_xgmi_link_rx{link_index="3"}

gpu_xgmi_link_tx{link_index="0"}
gpu_xgmi_link_tx{link_index="1"}
gpu_xgmi_link_tx{link_index="2"}
gpu_xgmi_link_tx{link_index="3"}
```

An example of this is shown below:

```json

## Performance Metrics

The Device Metrics Exporter now supports a whole list of Performance metrics
to better facilitate the developers to understand more about the application
performance on the GPUs

The `ProfilerMetrics` should be turned off in case of application level
profiling is run as the current hardware limits a single profiler instance to
be run at any given time.

By default the performance metrics are disabled and they can be  enabled through the
ConfigMap `ProfilerMetrics` to enable or disable per host (higer precedence) or `all` key to specify for cluster wide toggle.

The list comprises of all well known metrics supported by MI 200 & 300 platforms. 
Some fields which are not supported by platforms though enabled would not be exported. 
The full list of supported Fields and Registers are available at [Performance Counters](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/conceptual/gpu-arch/mi300-mi200-performance-counters.html).
